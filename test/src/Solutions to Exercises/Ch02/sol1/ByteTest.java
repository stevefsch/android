    // Don't forget that these integer calculations will be done
    // with 32 bits precision. The result is then stored in data taking the
    // low-order 8 bits of the result as the value to be stored.
    // Since we multiply the -128 value by 2, the result is -256. In binary the
    // low-order 8 bits for this value are zero.
    
    // This calculation would normally be done in a loop (subject covered in chapter 3).
