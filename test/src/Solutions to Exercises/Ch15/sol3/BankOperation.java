// Chapter 15 Exercise 3
import java.util.Random;

/*
 This exercise is a little tricky since we have supervisor threads to deal with
 as well as clerk threads. Clerks have names to identify who is doing what.
 Here there are sufficient names for the number of Clerk objects to be created
 but if you wanted to generalize the naming of clerks to allow for more clerks
 than names, you could reference elements in the clerkNames array using an 
 index modulo the size of the array.
 
 Once the two Supervisor objects have been created, they are each assigned their clerks
 by calling the addClerk() method for the supervisor for each clerk in their team.

 Each Supervisor object has the task of creating transactions and assigning 
 them to the clerks in the team. Once this work has been completed, nominally the
 supervisor is done, but we must make sure that each supervisor appears to be busy
 as long as any of their clerks are busy. This is accomplished through the busy
 member of each Supervisor object. Without this arrangement, the main thread could
 (and almost certainly would) complete execution before the clerks had processed the
 transactions and so the program would end without updating the accounts.
